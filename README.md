- Edit existing tasks inline
- Delete individual tasks or clear all completed tasks
- Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed)
- Search through tasks by keyword
- Persist all data locally across browser sessions
- Use keyboard shortcuts for quick task management
- Access the app seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices

## üîß 3. Features to Build

- Local storage persistence for all tasks

### Intermediate Features
- Edit tasks inline by double-clicking
- Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)
- Clear all completed tasks with single button
- Task counter showing active tasks remaining
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to add, Escape to cancel edit)
- Search functionality to find specific tasks
- Due date assignment with date picker
- Priority levels (High, Medium, Low) with color coding

### Advanced Features
- Drag and drop task reordering
- Categories/tags for task organization  
- Dark/light mode toggle with preference persistence
- Task export to JSON format
- Bulk operations (select multiple tasks)
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys and Tab
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, screen reader support)

## üß™ 5. Things This Project Will Teach Me

### JavaScript Concepts
- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating, modifying, and removing elements
- **Event Handling**: Click, keypress, change, input events
- **Event Delegation**: Handling events on dynamically created elements
- **Local Storage API**: Storing and retrieving persistent data
- **Array Methods**: filter(), map(), forEach(), find(), some()
- **Template Literals**: Dynamic HTML string generation
- **Conditional Rendering**: Showing/hiding elements based on state
- **Form Validation**: Ensuring valid input before processing
- **Debouncing**: Optimizing search input performance
- **Date Handling**: Working with Date objects and formatting

### HTML Elements & Attributes
- Form elements (input, button, select)
- Semantic HTML (main, section, article, aside)
- ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-checked, role)
- Data attributes (data-id, data-status)
- Input types (text, date, checkbox)

### CSS Techniques
- **Flexbox**: Layout for task items and controls
- **CSS Grid**: Overall app layout structure
- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth hover and state changes
- **CSS Animations**: Task addition/deletion effects
- **Media Queries**: Responsive design breakpoints
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Theme variables for dark/light mode
- **Pseudo-classes**: :hover, :focus, :checked styling
- **Transform Property**: Scale and translate effects

### Browser APIs
- localStorage for data persistence
- addEventListener for event handling
- querySelector/querySelectorAll for DOM selection
- classList API for dynamic class management

## üåê 6. API Integration

### Mock API Simulation
Since this is a local-first app, we'll simulate API calls for learning purposes:

#### Mock Endpoints
```javascript
// Simulate GET /api/todos
const mockGetTodos = () => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({
        status: 200,
        data: [
          {
            id: 1,
            text: "Learn JavaScript",
            completed: false,
            dueDate: "2024-12-31",
            priority: "high",
            createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
          },
          {
            id: 2,
            text: "Build todo app",
            completed: true,
            dueDate: "2024-01-20",
            priority: "medium",
            createdAt: "2024-01-10T14:15:00Z"
          }
        ]
      });
    }, 500);
  });
};

// Simulate POST /api/todos
const mockCreateTodo = (todoData) => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({
        status: 201,
        data: {
          id: Date.now(),
          ...todoData,
          createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
        }
      });
    }, 300);
  });
};
```

#### Implementation Example
```javascript
async function loadTodos() {
  try {
    const response = await mockGetTodos();
    const todos = response.data;
    renderTodos(todos);
  } catch (error) {
    showErrorMessage('Failed to load todos');
  }
}
```

## üé® Design Considerations

### Color Scheme
- Primary: #4A90E2 (blue for action items)
- Success: #7ED321 (green for completed tasks)
- Warning: #F5A623 (orange for due soon)
- Error: #D0021B (red for overdue/delete actions)
- Neutral: #9B9B9B (gray for inactive elements)

### Typography
- Headers: System font stack for performance
- Body: Clean, readable sans-serif
- Monospace: For dates and technical info

### Interaction Patterns
- Hover states for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Loading states for async operations
- Empty states with helpful guidance
- Error states with recovery options
